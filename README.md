# RTL-Whatsapp
Makes the [Whatsapp's web interface](https://web.whatsapp.com/) work properly with Hebrew (RTL).

This changes the entire interface to RTL, so if you're using English in your conversations it probably isn't for you.

Currently only works in Chrome and Firefox.

# How to install for Firefox:
1. Install the [Stylish Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish/ "Stylish's Firefox add-on page").
2. Install the [WhatsappRTL style](https://userstyles.org/styles/110154/whatsapprtl "The WhatsappRTL Stylish page.").
3. Test to [see if it works](https://web.whatsapp.com/ "WhatsApp web interface.").
