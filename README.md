# RTL-Whatsapp
Makes the [Whatsapp's web interface](https://https://web.whatsapp.com/) work properly with Hebrew (RTL).

This changes the entire interface to RTL, so if you're using English in your conversations it probably isn't for you.

Currently only works in Chrome (because that's the only version of the Whatsapp web interface that is available).

# How to install:
1. Install the [Stylish Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe "Stylish's Chrome Web Store page").
2. Install the [WhatsappRTL style](https://userstyles.org/styles/110154/whatsapprtl "The WhatsappRTL Stylish page.").
3. Test to [see if it works](https://web.whatsapp.com/ "WhatsApp web interface.").
