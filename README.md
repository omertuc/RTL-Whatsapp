# RTL-Whatsapp
Makes the Whatsapp's web interface work properly with Hebrew (RTL).

Currently only works in Chrome (because that's the only version of the Whatsapp web interface that is available).

# How to install:
1. Install the [Stylish Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe "Stylish's Chrome Web Store page").
2. Install the [WhatsappRTL style](https://userstyles.org/styles/110154/whatsapprtl "The WhatsappRTL Stylish page.").
3. That's it.
